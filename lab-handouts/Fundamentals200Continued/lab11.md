# Data Generation with GitHub Copilot

## Introduction

To utilize Copilot for data generation, you can start by describing your data generation needs and write code that outlines the process. Copilot will then provide code suggestions based on the context you've provided. ​There are many ways to utilize GitHub Copilot for data generation, including: 

- Mock data generation
- Generating random numbers
- Data validation
- Data transformation
- Generating user profiles
- Database query generation
- Complex data structures
- Data formatting
​
### Task 1 - Mock Data Generation & Generating Random Numbers

1. Open the `employee_evaluation.py` file in the `lab-files` directory.

This program is meant to generate an employee evaluation based on a few factors: 
- Employee name
- Job title
- Performance score
- Areas of improvement (either time management, communication, technical writing, or technical skills)

Currently, this program does not have any way of generating these factors. Let's use GitHub Copilot to generate some mock data for testing purposes!

2. Select the code in `employee_evaluation.py` and prompt GitHub Copilot Chat to generate a function for creating mock data for the function parameters, name this function `generate_mock_data()`:
- `Generate a function that will create mock data for the generate_employee_evaluation() parameters. Areas of improvement should either be: time management, communication, technical writing, or technical skills`

This prompt _should_ generate a function that uses the `random` library. Such as below: 

```
import random

def generate_mock_data():
    names = ["John Doe", "Jane Smith", "Bob Johnson", "Alice Williams", "Charlie Brown"]
    job_titles = ["Software Engineer", "Data Analyst", "Project Manager", "Product Owner", "QA Engineer"]
    areas_of_improvement_options = ["time management", "communication", "technical writing", "technical skills"]

    name = random.choice(names)
    job_title = random.choice(job_titles)
    performance_score = round(random.uniform(1, 5), 2)  # Score between 1 and 5
    areas_of_improvement = random.sample(areas_of_improvement_options, random.randint(1, len(areas_of_improvement_options)))  # 1 to 4 areas of improvement

    return name, job_title, performance_score, areas_of_improvement
```

3. Reprompt GitHub Copilot Chat to use the `random` library if the its first suggestion does not

4. Add the import statement and function to the `employee_evaluation.py` file

5. Prompt inline GitHub Copilot Chat (Ctrl + I) to add the new function to the main method, so that the program can be run
- `Add the generate_mock_data() function to the main method so that the program can be run`

6. Save the `employee_evaluation.py` file


### Task 2 - Data Validation, and Formatting

Still in `employee_evaluation.py` add functionality for supervisors/reviewers to add their own information to the evaluation: 

1. Select all of the code in `employee_evaluation.py` and prompt GitHub Copilot Chat to create a function named `reviewer_information_input()` for reviewers to input their information
- `Create a function that will allow reviewers to input their personal information, including: Name, title, and email`

2. Add the `reviewer_information_input()` function generated by GitHub Copilot to the `employee_evaluation.py` file. Prompt inline GitHub Copilot Chat (Ctrl + I) to add the new function to the employee evaluation:
- `Add the reviewer_information_input() function to the employee evaluation`

3. Select the `reviewer_information_input()` function and prompt GitHub Copilot Chat to validate the given email address:
- `Add code to the selected function to validate the email address`

4. Select all of the code in the `employee_evaluation.py` and prompt GitHub Copilot Chat to create a new function to take company and date details as input named `company_day_details()`, add the function to the `employee_evaluation.py` file: 
- `Create a function that will allow a user to input the company name, date of document completion, and date for future employee review`

5. Prompt inline GitHub Copilot Chat (Ctrl + I) to add the new `company_day_details()` function to the employee evaluation: 
- `Add the company_day_details() to the employee evaluation`

6. Select the code in the `employee_evaluation.py` and prompt inline GitHub Copilot Chat (Ctrl + I) to format the dates in the Month, Day, Year, format:
- `Format all dates as "Month, date, year" in the employee evaluation. The dates should look like this: May 1st, 2024`

7. Accept the changes, and save the `employee_evaluation.py` file


### Task 3 - Complex Data Structures

Adding in data structures can be beneficial for data management, and ease of understanding. Let's add in a JSON object to our `employee_evaluation.py` file!

1. Add functionality for our areas of improvement to correspond to an abbreviation as follows: 
- time management --> TM
- communication --> COMM
- technical writing --> TECH-W
- technical skills --> TECH-S

2. Select the code in the `generate_mock_data()` function and prompt GitHub Copilot Chat to modify the function to use a dictionary for the areas of improvement:

```
Modify the selected code to use a dictionary for areas of improvement. Areas of improvement should correspond to an abbreviation as follows: 
- time management --> TM
- communication --> COMM
- technical writing --> TECH-W
- technical skills --> TECH-S

Return the abreviation of the randomized area of improvement.
```

3. Add the newly suggested code to the file, replacing the old `generate_mock_data()` function

4. Run the `employee_evaluation.py` file and troubleshoot as needed, prompting GitHub Copilot for help on any errors or formatting issues that are encountered. The final program should print an employee evaluation in the terminal:
- `python employee_evaluation.py`

5. Save any changes that you make, and rerun as necessary
